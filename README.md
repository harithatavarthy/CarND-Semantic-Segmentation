## Introduction
The goal of this project is to label the pixels of a road in the given testimages with about 80% accuracy, using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).  as described in the paper [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ejonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf) by Jonathan Long, Evan Shelhamer, and Trevor Darrell from UC Berkeley. The projects is based on [Udacity's starter project](https://github.com/darienmt/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation-P2).

A semantic segmentation  model is build on top of a VGG-16 image classifer to retain the spatial information and then upsample to the original image size. Once the model is build, it has been trained by tuning hyper parameters in such a way that the overall loss of the model is minimized. After model is trained to reasonably sufficient levels, inferences are made against the test data/images.

The following image shows exemplarily the result of the VGG-16 based FCN which has been trained to determine road (green) and non-road (not marked) areas.

## Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) Architecture

The Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is based on a pre-rained VGG-16 image classification network. The VGG-16 network acts as a encoder. In order to implement the decoder, I extracted layer 3, 4 and 7 from the VGG-16 ([`main.py` line 81](https://github.com/harithatavarthy/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation/blob/master/main.py#L81)) network and implemented several upsampling and skip connections ([`main.py` line 116](https://github.com/harithatavarthy/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation/blob/master/main.py#L116)). The image below shows the schematic Decoder architecture. 

![Decoder architecture][image_Decoder]

Each convolution `conv2d()`and `conv2d_transpose()` of the decoder has been setup with a kernel initializer (`tf.truncated_normal_initializer`) and a kernel regularizer (`tf.contrib.layers.l2_regularizer`). This will ensure quick convergence of training loss as well as elimination of features that are least importance for learning.

## Training on AWS EC2 Instance
The FCN has been trained on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 g2.2xlarge instance with the following hardware configuration.

- 8 vCPUs (Intel Xeon E5-2670)
- 1 GPU (NVIDIA 1536 CUDA processor with 4 GB video RAM)
- 15 GB RAM
- 60 GB SSD

To setup the EC2 instance with python v3.5.2, tensorflow v1.4 and all dependencies, I created an anaconda environment file [environment.yml](https://github.com/SvenMuc/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation-P12/blob/master/environment.yml) which creates the `carnd-term3` environment.

The following command prepares the anaconda environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The [install_data.sh](https://github.com/SvenMuc/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation-P12/blob/master/install_data.sh) script downloads the pre-trained VGG-16 network and the KITTI road dataset. Now everything is prepared to start the training.

### Training Set
As training set I used the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip). It consists of 289 training and 290 test images. Furhter details can be found in the [ITCS 2013 publication](http://www.cvlibs.net/publications/Fritsch2013ITSC.pdf) from Jannik Fritsch, Tobias KÃ¼hnl, Andreas Geiger.

| abbreviation | #train | #test | description                |
|:-------------|:------:|:-----:|:---------------------------|
| uu           |   98   |  100  | urban unmarked             |
| um           |   95   |  96   | urban marked               |
| umm          |   96   |  94   | urban multiple marked lane |
| URBAN        |  289   |  290  | total (all three subsets)  |

### Hyper-Parameters
Due to the limited video RAM the batch size has been limited to 2. The total training time for 289 training samples took 1h and 18 min for 20 epochs.

| Parameter           |  Value  |
|:--------------------|:-------:|
| KERNEL_INIT_STD_DEV |  0.001  |
| L2_REG              | 0.00001 |
| KEEP_PROB           |   0.5   |
| LEARNING_RATE       | 0.0001  |
| EPOCHS              |   20    |
| BATCH_SIZE          |    2    |

### Cross Entropy Loss and IoU - Intersection-over-Union
In order to find the best model, I saved the trained model after each epoch and observed the cross entropy loss and IoU (Intersection-over-Union) values. The IoU values are calculated in the [`main.py`in line 180](https://github.com/SvenMuc/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation-P12/blob/0d8cc5ef1a61073c2fd31f0a7e2849edfbf5d415/main.py#L180).

As depicted in the two diagrams below the cross entropy loss value increased drastically after epoch 18 whereby the IoU value saturates. Therefore, I choose the trained model after epoch 18.

### Tensorboard
In order to visualize the FCN graph, the cross entropy and intersection-over-union progress I added several summary operations into the model and training methods. All relevant TensorBoard log files are stored in the `tensorboard_log` directory. The TensorBoard can be started with the following command. 

```
tensorboard --logdir=tensorboard_log/
```

## Results
The FCN classifies the road area quite well. It has some trouble to determine the road area in rail sections or in scenes with heavy cast shadows. This is due to the fact, that the training set with only 289 images is very small and not all scenarios in the test set are covered by the training set. By applying bigger training sets or image augmentation the performance could be further improved.

# Semantic Segmentation
### Introduction
In this project, you'll label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

### Setup
##### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
##### Dataset
Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.

### Start
##### Implement
Implement the code in the `main.py` module indicated by the "TODO" comments.
The comments indicated with "OPTIONAL" tag are not required to complete.
##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
```
python main.py
```
**Note** If running this in Jupyter Notebook system messages, such as those regarding test status, may appear in the terminal rather than the notebook.

### Submission
1. Ensure you've passed all the unit tests.
2. Ensure you pass all points on [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/989/view).
3. Submit the following in a zip file.
 - `helper.py`
 - `main.py`
 - `project_tests.py`
 - Newest inference images from `runs` folder  (**all images from the most recent run**)
 
 ### Tips
- The link for the frozen `VGG16` model is hardcoded into `helper.py`.  The model can be found [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/vgg.zip)
- The model is not vanilla `VGG16`, but a fully convolutional version, which already contains the 1x1 convolutions to replace the fully connected layers. Please see this [forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/here-is-some-advice-and-clarifications-about-the-semantic-segmentation-project/403100/8?u=subodh.malgonde) for more information.  A summary of additional points, follow. 
- The original FCN-8s was trained in stages. The authors later uploaded a version that was trained all at once to their GitHub repo.  The version in the GitHub repo has one important difference: The outputs of pooling layers 3 and 4 are scaled before they are fed into the 1x1 convolutions.  As a result, some students have found that the model learns much better with the scaling layers included. The model may not converge substantially faster, but may reach a higher IoU and accuracy. 
- When adding l2-regularization, setting a regularizer in the arguments of the `tf.layers` is not enough. Regularization loss terms must be manually added to your loss function. otherwise regularization is not implemented.
